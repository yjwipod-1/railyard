# Changelog

All notable public-facing changes to Railyard are summarized here.

## Unreleased / v0.4

- Documented the Epic Closure Contract so lane Architects explicitly own epic closure after verifying scoped ticket outcomes, done definitions, blockers, and dependencies.
- Added a public MCP-lite smoke example for disposable workflow validation.
- Added `scripts/validate_artifacts.py` for deterministic workflow artifact and example queue validation.
- Added GitHub Actions validation for compile checks, artifact validation, and MCP-lite smoke checks.
- Ignored `.claude/` local agent configuration so machine-local tool settings stay out of public releases.
- Added this changelog as part of release discipline and adoption hardening.

## v0.3

- Added the optional MCP-lite stdio control surface as a thin adapter over the existing helper-backed workflow contract.
- Added read and inspection tools for tickets, epics, ticket events, and workflow schema version.
- Added narrow lifecycle write tools for ticket claim, review start, runner result, and review result transitions.
- Added dispatch and validation tools that preserve the existing closed-loop Architect and Runner workflow.
- Added an MCP-lite probe that validates the tool surface against a copied workflow database.
- Documented the MCP-lite boundary and non-goals, including no raw SQL, broad admin mutation, direct source editing, or replacement of helper authority.

## v0.2

- Added helper-backed Runner dispatch support with spawn-ready handoff payloads.
- Hardened ticket lifecycle state transitions and review routing.
- Expanded workflow schema and helper behavior for durable runner results, review outcomes, and event tracking.
- Improved lifecycle, SQL, result format, and startup documentation.

## v0.1

- Introduced the core Railyard workflow scaffold.
- Added System and Domain lanes, epics, tickets, inbox and outbox files, and SQLite-backed workflow state.
- Added helper scripts for initializing workflow state, syncing epics and tickets, inspecting queues, and managing lifecycle transitions.
